Sunni was my first self-built rig. I based her off of one of my Dungeons and Dragons characters.

She was a great learning tool, and helped me build up my skills as a rigger. Sunni was designed and rigged solely in a 3/4 view, which taught me some important do's and don'ts around rigging a character.
