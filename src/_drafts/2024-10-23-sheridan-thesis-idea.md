title: "Thesis Film: The Idea"
description: So...I need to make a thesis film. Where do I start?

Iâ€™m in my fourth year of my bachelors degree in animation at Sheridan College. The requirements for this film are to have one minute of full animation completed in eight months (early September to early April). It can be any medium, and any story. We get put into a mentor group with one professor and in my case six other students to have weekly check in meetings. That should be everything you need to know before we start.

So, this journey begins in the second semester of my third year. I had a class called "Storyboarding: Project Development" that was targeted at the early development of our thesis film ideas for the upcoming year. In this class I had to pitch two different ideas, giving each of them a basic story treatment, a little bit of concept art, and some visual inspiration. 

At this point I had been developing a decently long note on my phone of all the ideas I've collected over the past three years...to which I used absolutely none of them. Great start. However, I did have a basic framework of what kind of story and characters I wanted to animate. I wanted to keep the setting in a place that I would find fun to draw, to no ones surprise that involved lots and lots of plants, but I wanted to keep the cast limited with the possibility of a big monster as the antagonist. I also had this idea to make a character that existed in a larger than life environment as a way to give the design of the film some interest. So with that, lets get to idea creating. 

## Pitch One - Floodgates

Floodgates is a story of a girl returning to her abandoned home to visit her mothers grave for the first time since she lost her in a flood that destroyed her town as a child. As she walks through the abandoned and overgrown town her grief begins to take hold and she drops the flowers intended for her mother and turns back to her car. As she begins her return, a creature stalks her from afar. Becoming aware of the monsters presence, she quickens her pace and the monster gives chase, sending her running into the destroyed site of her childhood home. Passing through painful memories, she continues to run before crashing through an old runoff drain, and plunging into deep water. The creature emerges from the water, consuming the girl and plunging her into darkness. She wakes up in a void to see a mirage of herself as a child being taken away from the flood by a neighbor as her mother gets trapped by falling debris. She reaches for her mom, crying out, but the mirage fades as she gets close. Behind her, an image of her younger self standing, surrounded by other crying children, emotionless and unwilling to accept or grieve the loss of her mother. As she walks towards her younger self, the other children fade, leaving only her and her younger self face to face. The girl crouches down to her younger self and begins to cry, pulling her into an embrace. The two cry together as the younger version of her fades into light, dissolving into her chest. She wakes up to the feeling of her face being licked. She is soaked and laying on the ground with a big dog standing over her. She sits up groggy as the dog runs away, grabbing the flowers meant for her mother and bringing them back to her happily. She pets the god and smiles as the two of them walk together to her mothers grave.

## Moving Forward

Alright, now we have some ideas to work with that I've spent a bit more time on. One little issue however...I'm making one film, not two. So, where do I go from here? 

My goal was to figure out what I liked and disliked about each idea so that I could decide how I wanted to move forward. Floodgates to me was a much stronger story and had a more compelling ending to it but the themes of the story are something I tossed in as a base for the story but it wasn't something I connected to on a deeper level. On the other hand, Starshot had a theme that was much more personal to me but was lacking the impactful ending that I was getting from Floodgates.

 So after splitting these ideas into two, I bring them back together as one again.

Now we're getting somewhere!

This is a story that is much more personal to me, keeps the setting simple yet effective with lots of plants, and it includes the monster and ending I like from Floodgates but with much stronger ties to the themes I'm going for with this story. 

One of the main goals of this story is to speak on something very personal to me, in a way that can be interpreted differently based on the experience of the audience. This is a story about coping with the the fact that mental illness is not something I can just ignore and will go away. It is a part of me that I may not like but will be with me forever so im better off learning how to accept it rather than repress it. It may not be a widely understood experience by everyone who watches it, but I found after spending a lot of time writing different stories, it was much more important to me to create a story that meant something to me and might be able to inspire the people who needed the space to reflect. 

But now im getting too sappy, so lets get back to actually making this happen. 

## Further Development 

Now that I have a story i'm happy with, it's time to start designing the visuals and thinking about how I actually plan on completing this film in eight months. 

Now for context, I was also in the middle of completing a summer internship at Pipeline Studios, so a lot of this concept art were small scribbles and ideas here and there. My plan was to leave the creation of the storyboard to the beginning of fourth year so that I had access to as many opinions and as much feedback as I could possibly get. There is a great advantage to starting the storyboarding process way before the year starts, but as someone who was a bit less confident going into it, I wanted to make sure I had lots of eyes on my project before I got overly attached to some scenes that were not working. 

First things first, the characters. 

Character design is something I find pretty difficult, and that's not considering the fact that i've now tossed creature design into the mix. So I wanted to get a bit of a head start on the designs during the summer since that is something I can easily get feedback on at a later date.  

# Lily

Although rushed, I was quite fond of the main character design I had made for Starshot (you can see the inspiration I took from that in the design of Lily) so I thought that would be a good place to start.
