# Web templates

This directory contains the abstract HTML definitions that are compiled together into the final website.

## Layout

- `base.html`: Everything extends this
- `index.html`: Things specific to the home page
- `page.html`: Things specific to a page (e.g. a blog post, a project, etc.)
- `section.html`: This is loaded any time a page lists a bunch of sub-pages
